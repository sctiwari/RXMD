Notes related to the ReaxFF force field development for Computational synthesis of MoS2 layers by Sungwook Hong - May 22, 2017
Collaboratory for Advanced Computing and Simulations (CACS) at USC has re-optimized ReaxFF reactive force field parameters for Mo/O/S to describe sulfidation of MoO3 surfaces for computational synthesis of MoS2 layers by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Details are as follows:
1.	Initial ReaxFF force field parameters for Mo/O, Mo/S, and O/S interactions were taken from Chenoweth et al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2009, 48, 7630-7634), Ostadhossein et al. (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2017, 8, 631-640), and Castro-Marcano et al. (Combust. Flame, 2012, 159m 1272), respectively.
2.	We then re-parameterized the ReaxFF parameters above to reasonably describe chemical reactions associated with the sulfidation of MoO3 surfaces; for this purpose, we included non-periodic cluster containing Mo/O/S elements – which can be reactants/intermediate structures/products during the CVD process and crystal structures of α-MoO3 and 2H-MoS2 along with some unstable crystal structures in our training set.  
3.	After re-parameterization, we performed reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations of the initial sulfidation process (S2 gas + α-MoO3 surface), and found that the surface reaction related to the synthesis of MoS2 layers can be achieved by a three-step reaction process: (1) O2 evolution and self-reduction of MoO3; (2) SO/SO2 formation and S2-assisted reduction; and (3) sulfidation of the reduced surface and Mo-S bond formation. This mechanism explains some of the experimental observations, including the predominant production of SO compared to SO2 as well as Mo redistribution and void formation during the CVD growth.
4.	Thus, this force field is capable of reasonably simulating the CVD growth of MoS2 layers with S2 gas phases and MoO3 surfaces.
